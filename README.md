# 📦 StockSense: Inventory & Reorder-Level Analytics

## Project Overview

StockSense is an inventory analytics project designed to provide clear visibility into stock levels, inventory value, and reorder risks across different product categories and suppliers. The project focuses on understanding how inventory quantity and financial exposure are distributed, while identifying products approaching critical reorder thresholds.

Using Microsoft Excel for initial data preparation and Power BI for analysis and visualization, this project demonstrates how data-driven insights can support better inventory planning, cost control, and supplier management decisions in a business environment.

## Observations & Insights

- Stationery products account for the highest stock quantity but contribute the lowest inventory value, indicating that the business holds large volumes of low-cost items, which increases storage usage without significantly increasing capital value.

- Electronics products hold comparatively lower stock quantities but contribute a high share of total inventory value, showing that fewer high-cost items consume a large portion of inventory investment.

- Accessories represent a balanced middle ground, with moderate stock levels and significant inventory value, suggesting consistent demand and steady capital allocation.

- TechHub dominates inventory value contribution compared to OfficePlus, meaning the business is financially more exposed to a single supplier for high-value inventory items.

- Only a small number of products are at or below their reorder levels, indicating that current inventory planning is generally effective, but specific high-value items still require close monitoring.

- Recent restocking activities are concentrated on high-value and operationally critical items, suggesting that replenishment decisions are being driven by business impact rather than volume alone.

---

## Recommendations

- Optimize stationery stock levels by reducing overstocking of low-cost items and adopting demand-based restocking to free up storage space and reduce unnecessary holding costs.

- Implement tighter monitoring and reorder alerts for electronics items, as their high unit costs mean stock shortages or overstocking can significantly impact cash flow.

- Diversify supplier dependency for high-value items, particularly those sourced from TechHub, to reduce financial risk and improve negotiation leverage.

- Maintain the current reorder strategy for most items, while introducing stricter reorder thresholds for critical or high-value products to prevent operational disruptions.

- Use restocking trends to formalize a replenishment schedule, ensuring that frequently restocked items are planned proactively rather than reactively.
